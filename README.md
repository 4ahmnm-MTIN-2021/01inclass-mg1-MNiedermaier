# CrackIn
*What's it about?

"CrackIn" is a 2D single player game which is shown from the top view. You are a penguin and you have to move on an ice platform. Pieces of the ice surface can break in at any time and form water leaks. You can move left and right. You automatically move up and the moving snowballs push the penguin down. Your task is in, to stay on the surface as long as possible and avoid the holes. You can collect delicious fish to get more points. Also there is a stop watch wich captures the time you survived on the sheet.
